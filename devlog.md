Note: I forgot to create the dev log while creating my project 1
Session 1: 10-01-2025
- downloaded the intial example code of cpu.py and mem.py from elearning 
- consulted and read the requirements for the project 1 and made notes on the requirements
Session 2: 10-02-2025
- Created the Driver.py, Encryption.py, and Logger.py files (didn't add any code)
Session 3: 10-05-2025
- Thought about how to implement the Logger file. Maybe it should be something like def Logger(message) and then parse the info in the function
- Changed mind on how to create logger functioin it will take three seperate parameters of the action, message, and log_file
